# DMS
A document management framework is the systematic structure or plan that guides how an organization creates, stores, shares, manages, and retires its electronic documents. It provides a consistent approach and sets rules for handling documents throughout their lifecycle, leveraging tools like a Document Management System (DMS) to ensure efficiency, security, collaboration, and compliance with legal and industry standards. Key components include centralized storage, version control, access permissions, audit trails, and workflow automation, all designed to make information accessible and secure. 
Key Components of a Document Management Framework
Centralized Repository:
A single, secure location for storing all documents, acting as a digital filing cabinet. 
Document Capture:
Processes for converting paper documents into digital formats or directly creating and inputting digital documents. 
Indexing & Metadata:
Assigning keywords and descriptive tags to documents to make them easier to search and retrieve. 
Version Control:
Tracking changes to documents, maintaining different versions, and documenting the revision history. 
Access Permissions:
Defining and managing who can view, edit, and approve documents to ensure security and control. 
Audit Trails:
Recording a log of all actions taken on a document, such as who accessed or modified it, for compliance and accountability. 
Workflow Automation:
Automating processes for document review, approval, and distribution to streamline operations. 
Search & Retrieval:
Tools to quickly find and access the necessary documents from the centralized repository. 
Purpose and Benefits
Efficiency & Productivity:
Streamlines document workflows, reducing manual effort and the time spent searching for information. 
Security & Compliance:
Enhances data security, controls access to sensitive information, and helps meet regulatory requirements. 
Collaboration:
Facilitates teamwork by providing tools for co-authoring and sharing documents securely. 
Cost Reduction:
Minimizes paper usage and storage costs by shifting to a digital system. 
Risk Mitigation:
Reduces the risk of lost documents, version control issues, and unauthorized access. 
In essence, a document management framework is a comprehensive plan for handling documents digitally, supported by a Document Management System (DMS) software that automates and secures the entire document lifecycle from creation to ar
